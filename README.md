### Protobot (Beta 1.3.1 Source Archive)

This repository contains all of the Unity source code used to create Protobot as of version Beta 1.3.1 released July 2022.

Note that this repository has been released in an archived state, meaning it is read-only and will not be maintained.

#### Other Notes:
- This version of Protobot uses Unity 2021.3.8f1 but should be able to update seamlessly to the latest 2021.3 LTS release.
- Documentation for the code itself is limited and there may be unused sections of code, this should be expected.
Used sections of code are well commented and organized in a modular way to be easy to understand and use effectively.
