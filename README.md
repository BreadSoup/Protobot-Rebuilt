**TO DOWNLOAD GO [HERE](https://github.com/BreadSoup/Protobot-Rebuilt/releases/latest) AND CLICK `Protobot.Rebuilt.zip` THEN UNZIP THE FILE AND DOUBLE CLICK `Protobot beta`**

#### Other Notes:
- This version of Protobot uses Unity **2021.3.5f1** but should be able to update seamlessly to the latest 2021.3 LTS release.
- Documentation for the code itself is limited and there may be unused sections of code, this should be expected.
Used sections of code are well commented and organized in a modular way to be easy to understand and use effectively.
